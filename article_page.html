        <div class="article-body">
            <p>
                Our world is waking up when it comes to sustainability and minimising our carbon footprints, 
                and with this more and more people are considering travel alternatives to the daily commute in the car.<br>
                The electric bicycle, sometimes fondly called the e-bike, marries the best parts of traditional vehicles and bikes.</p>
            <p> Here are a few reasons to consider going electric, whether for your daily commute or just leisure rides.</p>
            <h2>Environmental impact</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most obvious benefits of going e-bike is that they are far kinder to our environment than your standard fuel-powered vehicle, 
                and even conventional electric vehicles.<br> E-bikes produce zero emissions and can reduce the air pollution of urban areas. 
                According to a study by the European Cyclist's Federation (ECF), cycling only releases roughly 21 grams of C02e per passenger kilometre travelled, 
                compared with 271 grams of C02e per passenger kilometre in a car.
            </p>
            <h2>Health benefits</h2>
            <p>
                Though the electric motor on an e-bike assists you with pedalling, some manual pedalling is still required. 
                This is the perfect mode of transport to get your exercise in without over-exerting yourself on your way to work!<br> 
                Pedalling can have numerous benefits, including improved cardiovascular health, increased muscle strength, and reduced stress levels 
                - and with the assistance of a motor, you can cycle further for longer.
            </p>
            <h2>Convenience</h2>
            <p>
                Another benefit of using an electric bike is that it's easier to mauevere in traffic. 
                Electric bikes can significantly reduce traffic congestion in urban areas, <br> and you can take full advantage of recent investments in bicycle infrastructre. 
                Dedicated bike lanes and other amenities are making it easier and easier to travel by bike.
            </p>
            <h2>Cost benefits</h2>
            <p>
                Switching to an electric bike can be great for your wallet, as well as your health. 
                E-bikes don't require fuel, saving you hundreds or even thousands on your daily commute over the lifespan of your bike. <br>
                With free shipping on all bikes on our site, you'll save yourself some extra funds too!
            </p>
            <h2>Fun!</h2>
            <p>
                Last but by no means least, electric bikes offer an enjoyable riding experience. With a powerful electric motor to assist you, you can zip across town easily. <br>
                E-bikes make cycling more accessible, allowing you to explore new areas and try out different routes without so much worry about physical limitations.
            </p>
            <h2 id="sign-off">
            With all these benefits of going electric, what are you waiting for? Take the electric plunge and you'll never look back.
